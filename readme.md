# Locating roots VIA Change in Sign

## Procedure

- Input
- Find stationary points
- look between stationary points to find change in sign
- if change in sign found, go from root A to B in steps of 1, then when sign Change, go back in steps of 0.5, then fourth then so on till u get a root in X dp
- for the first root, if it’s a min below X axis or a Max above, go left and do the same
